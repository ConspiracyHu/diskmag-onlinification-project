# The Diskmag Onlinification Project

Porting old [disk magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_magazine) to the web.

## Concepts
* Never modify original data
* Hardcode as little as possible
* File-renaming is acceptable when necessary (removal of "#" or file name collisions)

## How to
We'll try and fill the [wiki](https://github.com/ConspiracyHu/diskmag-onlinification-project/wiki) up with
as much helpful reverse engineering information as we can.
